View -> Scope mode:

    Allows user to view spectrometer information in realtime.
    Typically, this will be light emission from samples in
    various forms for specific wavelength measurement applications
    which include emission, fluorescence, and Raman (laser
    induced scattering).

    Scope enables viewing emission from LEDs, laser diodes, flour-
    escent lamps, plasma, ignited metal or gas emission lines,
    emission lines from the stars when mounted in a telescope,
    light bulbs (all types), neon and other types of signs,
    UV or laser induced fluorescence from samples, and Raman
    scattering from samples.

    Each pixel is graphed on the x-axis as wavelength in nano-
    meters using the calibration parameters entered via setup.            
    Scope view will be affected by options available in
    the Setup menu including; detector integration rate (spectra
    signal level), number of scans to average (Y axis smoothing),
    pixel resolution (X axis smoothing), Temperature compensation
    (pulls dark spectra level to near zero over operating
    temperature range).

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
View -> Absorbance:

    Displays absorbance at pixel n using the current sample, 
    reference, and dark data sets:
            A(n)=-log((sample(n)-dark(n))/(ref(n)-dark(n)))

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
View -> Transmission:  (also use for Reflectance)

    Displays percent transmission at pixel n using the current 
    sample, reference and dark data sets:
            T(n)=((sample(n)-dark(n))/(ref(n)-dark(n))*100

    Percent transmission is mathamatically eqivalent to percent 
    reflection and is used for reflectance applications.
    Use transmission mode for SpectroColorimetry. Use a white
    light to reflect off of a white surface.  Save this as the
    reference.  Then replace the white standard with a color 
    sample to measure.  You will then see the spectral shape 
    for the color where the white standard displays as a 
    straight line at 100 percent.

    These spectroradiometer display modes provide a calibrated Y
    axis.  In order to use this mode, the unit requires certain
    system calibration files to exist.  Units ordered as a
    spectroradiometer include calibration files for operation
    in this display mode.  These files are installed by clicking
    on the MyCal-nnnnn.exe file provided in the installation disk.

    Note: the selected Radiometer mode (flux, irradiance, radiance)
    requires its respective calibration file to be loaded (prior to
    starting SpectraWiz.  A flux measurement can also be made if
    the calibration file is for irradiance.  See selections below.
    For radiance measurements a lens is attached to the CR2 light
    receptor and a radiance calibration must have be performed.

    To get moles, watts is multiplied by 0.00835 (an Einstein),
    which is a unit of energy in photochemistry, that represents
    a Dose of power that irradiates a sample for 1 second.  An
    Einstein is the amount of enery in 1 mole (Avogadro's number,
    6.0222 x 10^23) of photons. Another number displayed in this
    mode is PAR, which stands for Photosynthetically Active
    Radiation, and is the integral of power from 400-700nm in
    micro-moles per square meter per second.    

    For the illuminace display, the photopic response curve is used
    to formulate lumen per meter^2 which provides a LUX value.

    The Irradiance calibration function located under the Apps
    menu can re-generate system calibration files needed for
    operating in Irradiance view mode. This requires a calibrated
    source lamp with its calibration data stored in a disk file.
    An example irrad cal data (text file) "NIST.icd" is
    provided.  This file can be used to simulate an irradiance
    calibration and produce the required system calibration
    files needed for selectiong the Irradiance view mode.
    WARNING: the system irradiance cal files files such as
    SW1.icf thru SW8.icf can be easily overwritten.

    Like most instruments, it is good practice to re-calibrate
    the spectroradiometer every 6 months.

  Save or Load Cal file for the attached light receptor
  -----------------------------------------------------
    Use Save Cal to create a single file, named by you to
    preserve ther current system settings and SWx.ICF 
    files for each spectrometer channel installed in the
    system that is calibrated and currently operating.

    Use the Load Cal to specify and run a previously saved
    configuration from the SWCals folder.  Filenames
    should indicate configuration for light receptor
    and spectrometers.  Example filenames are:
    MyCal-BW804-CR2.cal       -single BLUE-Wave + CR2
    MyCal-BW804-RW202-IS6.cal -dual BW+RED-Wave + Sphere  

  Setup for Radiant and Luminous Flux Area in sq meter:
  ----------------------------------------------------
    CR1............ 11 mm diameter -> sq meter
    CR2............ 06 mm diameter -> sq meter
    IC2............ 0.625 inch diameter -> sq meter
    Other.......... user defined
    Exit flux area ... default area = 1 square meter

    Radiant flux (watts/nm) = irradiant w/m^2/nm * receptor area
    Luminous flux (lumen/nm) = illuminant LUX/m^2/nm * receptor area 
  
  Setup range for watt and Rflux measurements:
  -------------------------------------------
    Controls the numeric display that appears in the upper
    left hand graph region.  Here, you specify the start 
    and end wavelengths for the display of the total power 
    over the range you select.  The default range
    is 400-700nm.

  Setup compensation cor CR2 aperture
  -----------------------------------
     Use this selection to compensate the radiometer calibration when
     the CR2-AP (aperture) is installed.  A different aperture can be
     installed on each channel (up to 8 channels supported). Please 
     realized the system is calibrated without the aperture installed.
     The default value = 100 representing 100%T for no aperture.
     Each CR2-AP value = approx. 10%T - exact number on bag label or 
     can be easily measured using the spectrometer. 

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
View -> Ref spectra:

    Displays the reference and dark data previously saved as
    ref(n)-dark(n). This is useful for troubleshooting absorbance
    or transmission applications.  The Ref spectra must not be
    clipped at its peaks, indicating a bad reference.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
View -> Channel:

    Allows display selection for logical units when more than
    1 spectrometer is installed.  If you have multiple spectro-
    meters this selection allows you to view data from the diff-
    erent optical channels.  

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
View -> Multi-Graph:

    Allows display of multiple channels in a single graph.
    Re-select to turn this feature off.  The x-axis labeling can
    be switched by using view -> channel -> n.  All active 
    channels will be displayed.
   
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
View -> SnapShot:

    Allows user to freeze display.  Re-selecting SnapShot when the
    display is frozen will re-start normal realtime display.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
View -> Wave Ratio:

     Allows 2 wavelengths to be selected to be displayed as a
     ratio in the upper left hand corner.  The default values
     260/280 are used for DNA concentration measurement.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
View -> Y scale:

  Set Max Y:
    Allows the user to specify the Y axis scale top value.
    Selecting Y-axis rescale icon (left click) will override
    the Max Y via autoscale.  Entering a value of 0 will also
    perform an autoscale. 
 
 as Log:
    Converts the Y-axis into a Log base10 scale. Re-selecting
    will convert back to a linear Y-axis.   

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
View -> Zoom: ON/OFF

    Allows a selected region to be expanded to a full graph. 
    This option will work for any view mode. You are prompted 
    for X-axis left and right wavelength and Y-axis top and 
    bottom.  Selecting a bottom as a negative value allows
    proper viewing for differential displays.  The Y zoom also 
    can enabled by by right clicking on the Z button for mouse
    XY zoom described below.

    The status panel on bottom right of graph will show a "Z"
    when zoom is in effect.  This reminds you that the X axis
    has been zoomed.  You must re-select View -> Zoom to perform
    an "unZOOM" or click the Z button on the toolbar or click
    to the left side of the graph.

    You may also use the mouse to zoom by clicking on the left
    region and holding the button down while dragging (a box
    will appear to be expanding as you move) to the right side
    of the region of interest. When you lift the left mouse
    button the selected region will appear as the full graph.
    This process can be repeated several times, each time
    refining the area of interest smaller and smaller.

View -> Graph Trace as: 

    Overlay 
    Fat line
    with Background
    1st Derivative
    2nd Derivative
    Derivative Setup

    These options apply to any SpectraWiz view mode.  Overlay
    allows the graph trace to continuously plot without erasing
    the previous scan.  Fatline makes the trace fatter.  With
    Background allows installation of a BMP graphic for the graph.
    This option also offers a selection for grid lines to be
    displayed. To enable just grid lines without BMP graphic, 
    select cancel when prompted for graphic.

    Using spectral derivatives eliminate problems with offset
    differences in samples.  The spectral data is converted to a
    spectral reference of itself similar to measuring rate of
    change or accelaration.  It is common practice to use
    spectral derivatives when generating Neural Network training
    sets or performing PLS calibrations to determine spiecies
    concentrations.

    Derivative Setup allows selection of the following parameters:
    Gap size 2..15 (where 15 is standard)
    Dtype 0=left 1=symetric 2=right

    When Dtype=0 a non symetric derivative is computed. 
    The derivative algorithm starts on the left (lower
    wavelengths) and finishes on right. This leaves a gap size
    anomoly on the right where the computation runs out of data.
    Similarly, with Dtype=2 the anomoly is left on the left.
    The selection is important when specific information is
    detectable at the spectrum end (left or right).

    With Dtype=1 a symetric derivative is computed using the
    selected gap size.  Depending on the specific application
    where multi-variate detection is required, the Dtype
    selection will become an important factor to improve
    sensitivity along with selected gap size.
