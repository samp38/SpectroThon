Installing LV Runtime on Debian-based Linux running on i386 architecture


LabVIEW for Linux runtime engine v. 8.6 (the necessary version for our VIs, which are created in LVforL 8.6 on the officially-supported RedHat/CentOS on 32-bit Intel i386 architectures) can be found at 

     http://www.ni.com/download/labview-run-time-engine-8.6/1103/en/ 

...download this to the desktop or convenient folder.

Note this is an rpm installer for RedHat and other members of that branch of Linux.  So you need to convert to an installer suitable for Debian-branch distros like Mint and Ubuntu.  Fortunately this is easy.

a) Install alien from your distributionâ€™s repository using the package manager for your distro (e.g., Synaptic or apt)

b) After installation of alien is complete, in a root terminal, issue 

     alien -k --scripts name_of_.rpm_just_downloaded.rpm

You'll end up with a .deb installer in the same folder as the .rpm.  You may delete the .rpm at this point if you wish.

c) In a NON-root folder, double-click the .deb just created, or in terminal issue 

     sudo dpkg -i name_of_.deb_just_created.deb  

...authenticate and wait for it to complete; may take a couple minutes, be patient.


==> LabVIEW VIs created and packaged in LabVIEW for Linux 8.6 may now be executed just by double-clicking!

If the above does not work, perform the following, reboot, and then re-run the above steps.

Get getlibs.  (For example, it's available from http://usablesoftware.wordpress.com/2011/02/01/download-link-for-getlibs/ ...in this case the downloaded file needs to be renamed getlibs-all.deb as it's posted as getlibs-all-deb.pdf due to the poster's blog-engine restrictions.)

Unarchive the download if necessary.

Open the folder where getlibs-all.deb resides as root.

Double-click on getlibs-all, or in terminal: sudo dpkg -i getlibs-all.deb

Reboot.
